Building successfully a Maven-based Java project in your Eclipse is a prerequisite.
You are ready to test if you can build and run a Java Web application project with Maven in your Eclipse IDE. For this test we prepared a Maven-based HelloWorld Java project you can import and run.

1. Download the archive file [helloworld.zip](files/helloworld.zip?raw=true).

1. Extract the *helloworld.zip* archive to a directory of your choice

1. From the Eclipse menu, choose **File -> Import…** to open the Import wizard  
	![](images/20.png)

1. Choose **Maven->Existing Maven Projects** and click **Next**  
	![](images/21.png)

1. In the Import Maven Projects dialog:
	- Click **Browse** and select the helloworld directory where you have extracted the *helloworld.zip*
	- The *helloworld/pom.xml* will be listed in the Projects section
	- Select the checkbox of this *pom.xml*
	- Choose **Finish** to start importing the Maven project into your Eclipse workspace
	![](images/22.png)  
	
	>**Info**: POM is an acronym for Project Object Model. It is an XML representation of a Maven project held in a file named *pom.xml*. For more information see the Maven documentation.

1. In the Project Explorer view of the Java EE Perspective you should find now the imported *helloworld*  
	![](images/23.png)

1. Right-click on the *helloworld* project node to open the Context Menu. Choose **Run As -> Maven install** to start the Maven build for the *helloworld* project  
	![](images/24.png)

1. The Eclipse IDE will open a Console Tab that displays the build progress. You should see **BUILD SUCCESS**. If your build was not successful, please check the troubleshooting guide for Maven  
	![](images/25.png)

1. In Project Explorer view expand the project node **helloworld -> target** to find the built *helloworld.war* file.

	> Note: To see it you might have to refresh the project by right-clicking on the project-node and press Refresh  
	
	![](images/26.png)
	
1.  Maven has build successfully the *helloworld* Java web application and created a *helloworld.war* file (see console output for the location).
