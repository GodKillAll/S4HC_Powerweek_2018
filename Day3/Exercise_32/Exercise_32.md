1. You should receive a **Response Code** of **200**. Check the result in the **Response Body**: you should see a content like this  
	![](images/12.png)

1. Try again by changing the values for **numTopics** to **2** and **numTopicsPerDocs** to **1**  
	![](images/13.png)

1. What has changed? You should receive an answer similar to this  
	![](images/14.png)

1. You have completed the exercise! You have successfully used the Topic Detection API service to find **numKeywordsPerTopic** keywords and **numTopics** topics across all documents. The topics get a number, starting with 0. So, if you define 3 Topics, they will be numbered with 0, 1, 2. With **numTopicsPerDoc** you define how many of the topics of the entire document corpus can be found in one document. The algorithm chooses the number of topics which fits best and assigns them a score which is not normalized to 1.

### <a name="setup-dev-env"></a> Setup the Development Environment
For the exercises where we develop SAPUI5 and Java applications, we will work with the SAP WebIDE in SAP Cloud Platform. To save time, we prepared a project for you so that we can focus on the ML Foundation parts. This project needs to be imported into your SAP Web IDE workspace. You will extend the applications included in the project to test the SAP Leonardo ML services. 
In this chapter, you will initialize the SAP Web IDE and import the given project. It will be used later in the corresponding exercises.

Required resources for this step:

* [MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise.zip](files/MLFSAPUI5_Project_Exercise.zip?raw=true)
* [MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Solution.zip](files/MLFSAPUI5_Project_Solution.zip?raw=true) (only required if you get stuck with the exercise and you want to go straight to the solution)

### <a name="adjust-app"></a> Adjust the prepared SAPUI5 application to access your ML foundation services
For the exercises where we develop SAPUI5 and Java applications, we will work with the SAP WebIDE in SAP Cloud Platform. To save time, we prepared a project for you so that we can focus on the ML Foundation parts. This project needs to be imported into your SAP Web IDE workspace. You will extend the applications included in the project to test the SAP Leonardo ML services. 

1.	Go to your SAP Web IDE Full-Stack edition and open the file  *MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise/neo-app.json*  
	![](images/25b.png)

1. Add a new route to the new destination named **sapui5ml-api**, we previously created in the SAP CP cockpit. You can copy the following code into the file (pay attention to the first comma which separates this from the previous resources)

	```json
	,
	    {
	    	"path": "/ml",
	    	"target": {
	    		"type": "destination",
	    		"name": "sapui5ml-api"
	    	},
	    	"description": "ML API description"
	    }
	```
	![](images/26b.png)

1.	Scroll to the end of the *neo-app.json* file and add the String **"APIKey",** (pay attention to include the comma) to the **headerWhiteList** section and then **save** the file. This is how the file should look after these operations  
	![](images/27b.png)

1.	Open the file *MLFSAPUI5\_Project\_Exercise/webapp/model/settings.json*
	![](images/28b.png)

1. Before we proceed with editing the *settings.json*, we need to get the **API Key** for the ML services from the API Business Hub, explained in the next steps

1.	Go to <https://api.sap.com> and click on **Try New Design**
	![](images/29b.png)

1.	Click on the **Log On** button on the top right corner and login with the credentials provided by your instructor  
	![](images/30b.png)

1.	Once logged in, click on the drop down list in the top right corner of the screen and choose **Preferences**  
	![](images/31b.png)

1.	Click on **Show API key**
	![](images/32b.png)

1. Click on **Copy Key and Close**: the API key gets copied in your clipboard  
	![](images/33b.png)

1. Now go back to your SAP Web IDE in SAP Cloud Platform, where the *settings.json* is still open.
For the two urls "Image Classification" and "Product Image Classification" replace the 
**<<<< COPY YOUR API KEY >>>>**  with the API key you copied in the clipboard and **save** the file
	![](images/34b.png)

1.	Click on the **Run** icon on the toolbar to execute the application   
	![](images/35b.png)

1. An application with two tiles comes up. Select the tile with the title **Image Classification**
	![](images/36b.png)

1. Extract the 4 images contained in the zip file ([test_images.zip](files/test_images.zip?raw=true)) you have downloaded already as explained in the prerequisites  

1. Select the *tennis_ball.jph* image and drag & drop it onto the camera icon
	![](images/37b.png)

1. The application charts the 5 most probable classifications for the image. To see the actual response from the server you can press the "View JSON" Button 
	![](images/38b.png)

1. Do the same for the other images by either dragging & dropping the selected image onto the icon or pressing the icon itself to open a file select dialog. Analyze the results

1. This concludes the exercise.
