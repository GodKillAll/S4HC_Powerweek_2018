## Summary

This concludes the exercise. In the preceding tutorials you created a custom business object with a simple data structure and its persistence. Afterwards you generated an UI for this business object and exposed it as an Fiori Launchpad application.
As the generated User Interfaces only list all fields of a business object node, adapting the UI might be necessary to improve usability of it.

Please proceed with next exercise.
